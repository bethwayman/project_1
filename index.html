                <h2>Beth Wayman</h2>
                <p>I was born in The Crimea (Ukraine). I was adopted by the most amazing 
                    family in 2002, along with three other boys. Since that time I have searched 
                    to find my place in this world. Growing up I was extremely creative and athletic. 
                    I loved sewing, painting, playing outside with my brothers. I signed up for all the 
                    sports, volleyball, basketball, tennis, cross country, and track and field. But 
                    nothing captured my heart quite like softball. I spent 12 years dedicating my mind, 
                    body, and my heart. Softball not only taught me dedication, but also leadership, 
                    teamwork, time management, and perseverance. I devoted countless hours to be the 
                    best player I could be. However, graduation came too soon and it was time to focus 
                    on other priorities. I have worked several jobs over the years trying to find something 
                    that would speak to me the way that softball did. However, nothing seemed to inspire me. 
                    It wasn’t until after I had my son that I realized I needed to find a new passion that 
                    would challenge me daily and spark my creativity. I started dedicating all my free time 
                    to learning web development. All of the sudden I feel the excitement that I got all those 
                    years ago rushing back. I had found my new passion. With the same determination, creativity, 
                    and persistence, I know that I can persevere.
